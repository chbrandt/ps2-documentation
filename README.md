# What is PlanetServer

PlanetServer is a Service component of the EC-funded EarthServer-2 project (#654367) aimed at serving and analyzing planetary data online, mainly through OGC Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS). The focus of PlanetServer is on complex hyperspectral imaging and topographic data.

The main Solar System targets for PlanetServer are Mars and the Moon.

Ingested datasets derive from NASA Planetary Data System (PDS) and ESA Planetary Science Archive (PSA).
